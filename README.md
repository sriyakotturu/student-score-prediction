# student-score-prediction
Simple Machine Learning project predicting student scores using Linear Regression.
#  Student Score Prediction (ML Project)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **simple Machine Learning pipeline** that predicts student exam scores based on study hours using **Linear Regression**.

## Steps Involved
1. Create a dataset of hours studied vs. score.
2. Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
3. Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error.
4. Automate predictions for any given input value.
5. Save the model for future use (`joblib`).

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Joblib


## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python student_score_prediction.py
